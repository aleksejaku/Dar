    <description>ChocolateyPackageUpdater (chocopkgup) - your automatic package updating solution for package maintainers.

This works in conjunction with ketarin to keep the chocolatey packages you maintain automatically updated. So you don't even have to think about updating a package or keeping it up to date. It just happens. Automatically, in the background, and even faster than you could make it happen. It's almost as if you were the application/tool author.

See https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/AutomaticPackages for creating automatic packages.

## FAQs

 1. Is it magic? I'm not sure.
 2. Does it work? Is like Schwarzenegger hard to spell?
 3. How does it work? See the project url for more information.
 4. Is it harder than maintaining a package myself? Not really. You pay an initial upfront cost, but it's small compared to maintenance over time.
 5. Is it perfect? Is anything?
 6. Is it free? Yes! As long as you release your packages openly at chocolatey.org, this is free! If you want to use it for private packages, you will need to pony up some $$.
